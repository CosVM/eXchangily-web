            <b>1. Basic Information</b>
        </mat-card-content>
        <mat-card-content>
            Exchangily is a multi-functional 3 in 1 crypto currency exchange platform including a decentralized wallet, crypto exchange and flash payment. 
        </mat-card-content>
        <mat-card-content>
            The mission of Exchangily is to provide users with a full range of integrated crypto-digital currency applications and management tools to fit their specific needs, including digital assets storage, management, multi-functional use, crypto trading, investment, financial services and other real-life application scenarios. 
        </mat-card-content>
        <mat-card-content>
            The most important key feature of Exchangily is decentralization. Decentralization means that the user’s assets are always under the control of the users without being controlled by any other institutions or individuals, and the user will not lose control of his/her assets throughout the whole process, whether if it is stored in the wallet or during the exchange transaction. 
        </mat-card-content>
        <mat-card-content>
            With Exchangily, the private key is the only controller of the user's assets. In this system, the private key is generated by the set of mnemonics. In other words, the set of mnemonics is the same as the private key. As long as you keep the mnemonics and the private keys and do not disclose it to anyone else, the user’s assets will always be safe and secure, which is very important for users to keep in mind.

            <b>2. Exchangily Wallet</b>
        </mat-card-content>
        <mat-card-content>
            Wallets are the gateway to the world of cryptocurrency, and the first step in getting involved in digital currency is to create and own a wallet.
            <br><br>
            <p><b>2.1 Create a wallet</b></p>
            <p>Click on [Wallet] in the menu navigation bar, if the user come to the Exchangily website for the first time in this device, a randomly generated set of mnemonics will pop up automatically, as follows: (This is only an example, do not use the helper word in the picture below to create your own wallet. You must copy it carefully in order and keep the  set of mnemonics safely, it is the only way to control the wallet.)</p>
            <p>After you have finished copying, press [Next] to enter the verification set of mnemonics.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image3.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>Step 2 is to verify the mnemonic and make sure you have recorded it accurately. In particular, it is recommended that users copy down the mnemonic and keep it safe, do not just cut the screen saver and store it in the device, in case the device is damaged or lost and you lose your wallet. Enter the word by the original record and press [Confirm]. Please note that if you press [Back] on this page, a new set of helper words will be generated and the user will have to copy them again.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image5.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>Step 3 is to name the wallet and set the password. The wallet names are for reference purposes only, for example, if multiple wallets have been created on the same device, one for Alice’s wallet, named with Alice3, and one for Jimmy's wallet, named with Jim4, so that you can distinguish which set of helper words is currently loaded. Some people may have multiple wallets, such as one wallet that is only deposited and not to be transferred out, named cold wallet, and another that is frequently sent or consumed for spending, named hot wallet.</p>
            <p>Then enter a password, which has a strength requirement of 8 or more characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one small letter, one number, and one special symbol (! @#$%^&*). It must be clear to the user that the password is only used as an encryption on this device for the private key or mnemonics that is generating the wallet to prevent damage from hackers infiltrating or loss of the device. It is not possible to recover or use the wallet by relying on the wallet name and password if it is detached from this device, because the user's private key is only stored in this device and is not sent to a remote server for storage.</p>
            <p>The wallet name or password does not need to be memorized, if you forget the password, just use the helper to recover the wallet, and the recovered wallet can be used with a different wallet name or password without any effect.</p>

            <p>First, get familiar with the structure of the Exchangily page. On the wallet page, it consists of the following five areas: menu area, summary area, asset list area, management area, and help center.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image8.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>
                <b>Menu area</b>

                <br> The name of the current wallet is displayed under [My Wallet], which is the name of the wallet called when the wallet was created.
                <br> After [EXG], the balance of EXG is displayed, and the value corresponding to fiat currency. Why are only EXG coins displayed at the top? Because EXG is the platform coin of Exchangily exchange, it enjoys the dividends of  Exchangily exchange income.
                <br> The address behind [Wallet Address] shows the EXG or FAB address of this wallet, besides being used to receive EXG or FAB coins, it is also the unique identity address of this wallet, which is used for exchange and flash payment and other functions. Click the symbol at the end of the address to copy this address.
                <br> The [Exchange Gas Balance] shows the balance of the wallet's gas in the exchange. If you want to engage in any operation in the exchange, including depositing coins to the exchange and trading in the exchange, you need to consume gas, so if you want to use the exchange, you need to add gas first. Therefore, the first step is to have FAB in your wallet.

                <br> Click on the icon to display the basic information of that coin, and click on the down arrow at the end of that coin's row to go to the page for transferring coins to the exchange.

            <p>Commonly wallet operation Guidelines</p>
            <p>2.3.2.1 Receiving money</p>
            <p>Click the [Receive] button in the summary area to bring up the Receive window. Select the currency you want to receive, then the corresponding wallet address and QR code will be displayed, copy and send the wallet address to the other party, or the other party can scan the QR code directly.

            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image6.png" class="photo"></p>
            <hr>
            <p>2.3.2.2 /images/help/en/image8.png</p>
            <p>Click on the [Send] button in the summary area and the payment window will pop up. Select the currency you want to pay in, enter the quantity, fill in the comment field with additional instructions for this transfer, and press the [Send] button.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image10.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>Few things about payments:
                <br>One is to be clear about which blockchain the coin being transferred is on, then there must be enough of that chain's main chain coins in the wallet to pay the transaction fee, for example, if you want to transfer USDT (ERC-20) coins, there must be enough ETH in the wallet to pay the Ether blockchain transaction fee, if you want to transfer USDT (TRC-20), then there must be enough TRX in the wallet to pay the wave field transaction fee, similarly, if you want to transfer EXG, DUSD, BST, DSC, etc., then there must be enough FAB in the wallet to pay the transaction fee of the issuing chain.
                <br>The other one is about transaction fee, usually the default transaction fee of the system is to ensure the payment can be completed at a faster speed, but sometimes the corresponding blockchain transactions are frequent and volatile, the default transaction fee may be too low, resulting in the inability to complete the transaction instantly, which is more common on ethereum or bitcoin blockchain, at this time, if you want to complete the transfer as soon as possible, you can set the transaction fee rate by clicking the [Advanced] button.
            </p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image2.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>Enter your wallet password and press [Confirm] to complete the transfer. Please note that after the transfer is completed, how long it takes for the other party to receive the money depends on the corresponding blockchain, some blockchains may be faster and receive it in a few seconds, some may be slower and take a few minutes, hours or even days. For details of the transaction, you can click on the transaction number in [Transaction History] to see the status of the transaction on the corresponding blockchain.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>2.3.2.3 Add Gas to the Exchange</p>
            <p>All activities of the Exchange consume gas, including depositing coins to the Exchange. Exchangily uses FAB coins as a gas. Therefore, before you can use the exchange, you must first add gas to the exchange, and to add gas, you must have FAB coins in your wallet.</p>
            <p>How do I get FAB coins? Sometimes Exchangily Wallet offers free gas, you can also buy them from others, or buy them with fiat coins through the OTC channel, or you can get them by mining, in short, to use the exchange, you must have FAB first.</p>
            <p>If you already have FAB in your wallet, click the [Add Gas] button in the summary area to bring up the Add Gas window, fill in the amount of Gas you want to add (usually a few FAB can handle many transactions), press the [Confirm] button, and then enter your password to confirm. Usually you have to wait a few minutes for the exchange gas balance number to show non-zero before you can perform the operation of depositing coins to the exchange.            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>2.3.2.4 Deposit coins to Exchangily</p>
            <p>The trading area is a different area from the wallet, although it is controlled by the same set of private keys. Therefore, to trade a particular coin, you must first move that coin from your wallet to the exchange. Please note that Exchangily is a decentralized exchange and coins transferred to the exchange are still controlled by your wallet's private key, and no one else can do anything with your assets, whether they are pending or cancelled, they are controlled by your private key.</p>
            <p>In the asset list area, there is a down arrow at the end of the line corresponding to the coin to be deposited to the exchange (if there is no down arrow shown it means that there is not enough gas in the exchange and it must be added first). Also, the user must be aware that transferring coins to an exchange is a cross-chain operation, and in addition to the exchange having enough FAB, the wallet must also have the main chain coins of the blockchain to which the coins to be transferred belong in order to pay the fees for that blockchain. For example, if you want to deposit UDST (ERC-20) to an exchange, you also need to have enough ETH in your wallet to pay the Ether transaction fee, if you want to deposit USDT (TRC-20), you must have enough TRX in your wallet to pay the wave field transaction fee, if you want to deposit EXG, DUSD, BST, DSC, you must have enough FAB in your wallet to pay the transaction fee of the issuing chain.</p>
            <p>Click the down arrow to pop up the deposit window, enter the quantity to be deposited, press [Confirm], the password window will pop up, enter the password to confirm. Please note that depositing coins to the exchange is a cross-chain operation, and you need to wait for both blockchains to finish processing before the number of coins deposited can be displayed on the exchange, and then you can trade.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>2.3.2.5 Display settings</p>
            <p>The wallet's high intensity password is set when the wallet was created. The system can also set a display password to control the displayed wallet information, such as displaying mnemonics, etc. If no display password is set, it is displayed with the wallet's password.</p>
